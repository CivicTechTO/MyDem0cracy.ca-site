question: Who created this website?
---

The creation of this website was spearheaded by [Derek
Howard](https://twitter.com/internautderek/) and [Patrick
Connolly](https://twitter.com/patconnolly), with the support of other members of the
[Civic Tech Toronto](http://civictech.ca/) community. We also owe a debt of
gratitude to [Team Pol.is](https://twitter.com/UsePolis), for their patience
and advice in helping us best use their tool.

It was built over the course of two [weekly
hacknights](http://meetup.com/Civic-Tech-Toronto/).
