question: Why does the visualized data look so boring?
---
Those who participated with this tool early on may have seen that the data
seems to be more interesting back then. There were 3-4 opinions groups all
favouring a high degree of electoral reform, and each group had a story to
explore in the data.

Sadly, a current limitation of the tool caused this to change. When new
participants supporting the current first-past-the-post system started
arriving, they caused the other groups to "collapse" into one. This was through
no fault of the new participants, but was simply an artefact of the current
mathematical modelling. The "stories" (along with others) are still buried in
the data, and can be teased out once we [release our open dataset](#open-data).
The issue is that the tool and visualization simply aren't robust enough at
this point, and unfortunately won't be remedied over the duration of this
particular consultation.

The Polis team are definitely thinking on long-term solutions for making the
data more explorable by all participants, and also more [short-term
solutions](https://github.com/pol-is/issues/issues/39) for moderators.
